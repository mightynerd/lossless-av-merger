lossless-av-merger
==================

A tool for merging multiple video files with the same specifications into one video file completely losslessly (without video or audio re-encoding and quality loss). Note that this program is in a very early development state and should therefore not be considered being suitable for regular usage.

It uses ffmpeg for the merging process and MediaInfo to get video duration.

Binaries for testing without compiling will be available soon!
