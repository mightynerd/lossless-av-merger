		<p>What input files lossless-av-merger supports depends on the ffmpeg binary. The best way
		to check that is to run ffmpeg with -codecs as a parameter in the command line. If you are
		not experienced with the command line you can still be fairly sure it will accept nearly
		anything you throw at it. Especially when it comes to popular codecs and containers. One important
		thing to remember is that the output container you want to use must support the input codecs.
		The best way to check if your container of choise supports a given codec is to use the media info
		function in lossless-av-merger (not implemented yet) and look at 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_container_formats">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_container_formats</a>
		and see if the container you chose supports the input codecs. This applies to both audio and video codecs.</p>
